Use pliers to gently lift the locks upward.

### Screws
![enter image description here](https://github.com/futojin/files/raw/main/stackedit/Dysonhead-screws.jpg)
1. Remove long screws 7x (red circle)
2. Remove short screw 1x (yellow circle)
3. Remove mid screw 1x (green circle)

:bulb: Tips
> There should be a silver sticker covering the green screw.<br/>
> Do NOT overtighten, especially the yellow screw.

### Back Sole Plate Disassembly
![enter image description here](https://github.com/futojin/files/raw/main/stackedit/Dysonhead-backsole-disassembly.jpg)

To separate the red bit and blue bit, pull the blue bit in the same direction with the arrow on the back. 

### Back Cover
![enter image description here](https://github.com/futojin/files/raw/main/stackedit/Dysonhead-backcover.jpg)
1. You need lift up the back cover (gently) to overcome the notch.  
2. Once you removed the back cover, undo the cable routing as well. The rubber tab can be easily lifted up.

### Clear Cover
![enter image description here](https://github.com/futojin/files/raw/main/stackedit/Dysonhead-clear-cover.jpg)

The clear cover should be easily removed. It is only held together with the pinch points as denoted by the arrows.

:bulb: Tips
> You should've undone the cable routing already (unlike shown)<br/>
> Gently pry it up if necessary

### Motor
![enter image description here](https://github.com/futojin/files/raw/main/stackedit/Dysonhead-motor.jpg)

The motor is only held by 2 notches on the side. To remove the motor, lift it up on an angle. 

:warning: WARNING
> Ensure you have undone the cable routing. <br/>
> The cable routing clearance around the motor is very tight. Ensure you're not damaging the cable.<br/>
> The motor and the neck are together. Don't attempt to remove the neck from the motor.

The seal is not a rubber but rather a foam on sticky tape. 

:warning: WARNING
> Do NOT submerge the clear cover.<br/> 
> Do NOT use harsh detergent.<br/>
> Clean / brush gently.

### Neck
Once the motor is removed, the neck can be removed easily.

### Final Pieces
You should have these separate components:
* Blue sole plate
* Back cover
* Clear cover
* Grey housing
* Motor and neck
* Screws

## Re-Assembly

### Motor Head

:bulb: Tips
> Align the motor assembly on a downward vertical angle. It's a very tight install! 

1. Align the (1) notch as shown. But don't push it yet.
2. Align the (2) notch as shown. But don't push it yet.
3. One hand on the cable to guide it when pushing down. Ensure its not pinched.
4. Push (1) and (2) together. Use some force but don't break it.

:warning: WARNING
> If not guided, the cable will be pinched when pushing down.

Route the cable as shown:
* Through the channel
* The black cable is underneath

### Neck

![enter image description here](https://github.com/futojin/files/raw/main/stackedit/Dysonhead-neck-assembly-completed.jpg)
* Align the notch and push down until you hear a click.
* Ensure the neck can move freely
* Ensure the cable oriented as shown (e.g. coming out on the top and curved)
* Ensure the cable isn't pinched

### Clear Cover
![enter image description here](https://github.com/futojin/files/raw/main/stackedit/Dysonhead-clearcover-assembly.jpg)

Clear cover install:
* You need to lift up the motor assembly to close the gap
*  Align the clear cover and snap into the place (those 4 pinch points)

Route the cable:
* Ensure the black cable is on the bottom as pictured
* Follow the arrow, ensure the slack are curved
* Put the black tab into its place
* Ensure the cable can freely move

### Back Cover
![enter image description here](https://github.com/futojin/files/raw/main/stackedit/Dysonhead-backcover-assembly.jpg)
* Align the bottom and the side as much as you can.
* Push down the notch against the neck. Some force required.
* Ensure all clips are tucked in on the side and on the bottom. 

### Screw
![enter image description here](https://github.com/futojin/files/raw/main/stackedit/Dysonhead-screws.jpg)
Put the screw back:
1. long screws 7x (red circle)
2. short screw 1x (yellow circle)
3. mid screw 1x (green circle)

:bulb: NOTE
> Ensure the back plate is *flush* when screwing.<br/>
> The short screw can only be done on an *angle*. Make sure you're compensating and not to strip the plastic hole.<br/>
> Make it tight, but not overdone.

### Back Sole Plate
